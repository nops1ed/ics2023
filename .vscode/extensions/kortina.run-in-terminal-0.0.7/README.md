# Run in Terminal, an Extension for `vscode`

Use a keyboard shortcut to run any command in the Integrated Terminal of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You can [install it from the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.run-in-terminal).

I built this because I wanted something for `vscode` like benmills' amazing [vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux) for `vim`.

The [send-to-terminal](https://github.com/malkomalko/send-to-terminal) extension was close to what I wanted,
but I wanted to be able to run more than 2 commands per filetype match.
`run-in-terminal` is based on `send-to-terminal`, but allows an arbitrary number of commands per filetype.

The native `Tasks` functionality in `vscode` is also close, but configuration is only possible at
the project level, [not the global level](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1435).

Here is what `Run in Terminal` looks like:

## `keybindings.json`

The simplest way to configure a `keybindings.json` using the `cmd` argument for the `runInTerminal.run` command:

```
...
{
    "key": "ctrl+e",
    "command": "runInTerminal.run",
    "args": {"cmd": "/usr/bin/env bash ${relativeFile}", "match": ".*"},
    "when": "resourceLangId == shellscript"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+e",
    "command": "runInTerminal.run",
    "args": {"cmd": "/usr/bin/env python ${relativeFile}", "match": ".*"},
    "when": "resourceLangId == python"
},
...
```

Note above that when using `keybindings.json` you might use the 'when' context (rather than the `match` expression) to specify different commands with the same keybinding for different filetypes. If you do so, use '.\*' as your match expression.

## `settings.json`

If you are using [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim), things look a little bit different, because there is no support for a 'when' context to perform different commands for different filetypes.

### 'runInTerminal.commands'

Here is what you might put in your `settings.json` when configuring with VSCodeVim:

```
...
    "vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
        {
            "before": ["<leader>", "r", "a"], "after": [],
            "commands": [ {"command": "runInTerminal.runLast" } ]
        },
        {
            "before": ["<leader>", "r", "l"], "after": [],
            "commands": [ {"command": "runInTerminal.run", "args": {"name": "l"}} ]
        },
        {
            "before": ["<leader>", "r", "b"], "after": [],
            "commands": [ {"command": "runInTerminal.run", "args": {"name": "b"}} ]
        },
        {
            "before": ["<leader>", "r", "s"], "after": [],
            "commands": [ {"command": "runInTerminal.run", "args": {"name": "s"}} ]
        }
    ],
    "runInTerminal.commands": [
        {"match": "_spec\\.rb$", "name": "l", "cmd": "./bin/rspec ${relativeFile}:${line}"},
        {"match": "_spec\\.rb$", "name": "b", "cmd": "./bin/rspec ${relativeFile}"},
        {"match": "_spec\\.rb$", "name": "s", "cmd": "./bin/rspec"},
        {"match": "(spec|test)\\.js$", "name": "b", "cmd": "xvfb-run ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start --single-run=true --single-file=\"${relativeFile}\""}
    ],
...
```

Note above, you specify each keybinding in your `vim` settings only once with a target `name`, and then in your `runInTerminal.commands`, you can specify multiple commands with the same `name` but different file `match` expressions. In this case, `<leader> r b` maps to the `name` 'b', which has a command for `ruby` and for `javascript`.

### 'runInTerminal.clearBeforeRun'

```
...
    "runInTerminal.clearBeforeRun": false, // defaults false
...
```

## Substitution Tokens

You can use the following substitution tokens in `cmd` strings:

- `${column}`
- `${cwd}`
- `${env.Name}` (replace environment variables)
- `${file}`
- `${fileBasename}`
- `${fileBasenameNoExt}`
- `${fileDirname}`
- `${fileExtname}`
- `${line}`
- `${relativeFile}`
- `${workspaceRoot}`

## Commands

### `runInTerminal.run`

You should provide an `object` as the value of the `arguments` key when calling this command. This object must have **either** (i) a `name` pointing to a command in `runInTerminal.commands` **or** (ii) a file `match` expression **and** `cmd` to execute.

(i)

```
...
    "command": "runInTerminal.run",
    "args": {"name": "focused"},
...
```

(ii)

```
...
    "command": "runInTerminal.run",
    "args": {"match": "\\.py$", "cmd": "/usr/bin/env python ${relativeFile}"},
...
```

### `runInTerminal.runLast`

Runs the last `cmd` run by `runInTerminal.run` again.

## Example of a Javascript / Typescript Line Runner

Here is an example of a VS Code extension, written in typescript, with a line runner bound to `,rl`:

A shell script that finds the jest bdd description given a `file:lineno`:

My `vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive` bindings to `runInTerminal` in `settings.json`:

## Known Issues

- The `${relativeFile}` substitution token only works when you have opened an entire folder with `vscode`, not a single file.
- Unknown behavior when many commands in 'runInTerminal.commands' match both the `match` expression and `name` of the command run.

## Development and Release

To run locally
```sh
# install deps
npm install --dev
```

To create a new release,

```sh
# bump version number in package.json
npm run vpackage # package the release, creates vsix
npm run vpublish # publish to store, see https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension
# Will prompt for Azure Devops Personal Access Token, get fresh one at:
# https://dev.azure.com/andrewkortina/
# On "Error: Failed Request: Unauthorized(401)"
# see: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/11
# The reason for returning 401 was that I didn't set the Accounts setting to all accessible accounts.
```
